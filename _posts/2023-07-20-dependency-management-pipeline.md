First blog post, opening the scene with the simple [CMake](https://cmake.org/) hints.

During the development of my hobby C/C++ projects, I found myself spending too much time on dependency management. Especially during the initial steps of project.

_Here is the basic overview for the initial dependency tasks I dealt with:_
* Download the release version of dependency by respecting the compiler I'll use
* Configure the IDE that I'll be using for the dependency

Well, the list looks small but it starts to feel huge with every new project that I start. Repeating same tasks over and over again. Things needs to be automated!

CMake comes to rescue!
